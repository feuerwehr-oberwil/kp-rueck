"""The roster-snapshot contract: what a published personnel file must look like.

`roster.source: "snapshot"` (docs/CONFIGURATION.md §4c) lets a station point this deployment at
a **roster file somebody else publishes** — a personnel system, a canton-level register, a
sibling application, a nightly export written by a script. It is one personnel provider among
several, selectable and disconnectable, and never required: a station that publishes nothing
runs on `"manual"` or `"divera"` exactly as before.

**This module is the contract, not the ingestion.** It defines the document, validates one,
prints its JSON Schema and prints a worked example. It does not fetch, schedule, match or write
anything: the shared rules for that are ``roster_snapshot_ingest.py`` (fetch + reconcile, pure),
and each product writes the result into its own tables in its own wrapper. This file, the
ingest module and both schemas are byte-identical in KP Front and KP Rück, pinned by checksum
on both sides and diffed by kp-rück's ``roster-schema-drift`` job — editing any of them is a
two-repository change.

Run from ``backend/`` via ``uv run python -m app.roster_snapshot <cmd>``:

    schema                 print the JSON Schema of a snapshot document (the contract)
    outcome-schema         print the JSON Schema of the reconciliation report a consumer emits
    example                print a populated example snapshot you can edit
    validate <file>        parse + validate a snapshot file (no DB, no network)

The committed copies of both schemas live in ``docs/roster-snapshot.schema.json`` and
``docs/roster-snapshot-outcome.schema.json``; ``just roster-schema`` regenerates them and a
test fails when they drift from this module, the same arrangement `docs/openapi.json` has.

WHAT IT CARRIES, AND WHY THAT LIST IS SHORT
-------------------------------------------
A snapshot is the same domain as the `"manual"` CSV — the people, and what the app needs to
show them in a picker: a stable id, a name, a Dienstgrad, whether they are still in. Plus one
thing the CSV does badly: ``identities``, a neutral list of ``(provider, external_id)`` pairs
that lands in ``personnel_external_identities``. There is deliberately no ``divera_id``-shaped
field. Vendor columns are deprecated in this product and in kp-rück; a snapshot that named one
alerting system in its schema would re-introduce the coupling both products spent a migration
removing, and it would be wrong for every station using a different one.

NO MEDICAL FIELDS, EVER — AND THAT IS A TEST, NOT A SENTENCE
------------------------------------------------------------
Personnel files are where Arztuntersuchungs-Dates, Tauglichkeit, Impfungen and absences live in
most fire-service systems, and none of them belong in a snapshot an incident-command app reads
at 3am. "Ever" is a claim about every future edit of this file, so it is held by
:func:`medical_shaped`, which matches a *category* of names rather than a list of three known
ones, and by the contract test that runs it over both schemas, the example and this module's
own fields. :func:`parse_snapshot` runs it over the incoming document too, so a producer that
adds such a key is told why the file was refused instead of having it silently ignored.

What that catches and what it does not is written out in the test's docstring. The short
version: it catches a medically *named* key; it cannot catch medical content wearing a neutral
name. That is why this schema has **no free-form blob and no ``qualifications`` list** — a
string map or a raw qualification list is precisely where "Atemschutz-Tauglichkeit bis 2027"
would arrive under a name no shape test can object to. ``rank`` is the derived, non-medical
projection the app actually uses.
