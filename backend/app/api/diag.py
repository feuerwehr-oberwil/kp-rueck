"""Diagnostics: the station's own error sink, and the bundle an operator can hand over.

The sink came first and is still the primary thing this module does — a crash on the board is
invisible to whoever runs the server, so the browser posts uncaught errors here and they
surface in the SERVER log, on the station's own machine, where the deployer already looks.
That path needs no consent and no network: it is the app telling its own operator what
happened.

* ``POST /diag/client-error`` — the sink. Always logged and always buffered locally
  (``telemetry/recent.py``); additionally queued for an upstream ingest only when an admin
  has switched telemetry on AND the deployer configured a DSN. Unauthenticated (a crash can
  happen on the login screen), so it is capped per hour on top of the client's own cap.
* ``GET /diag/export`` — the bundle an operator downloads and attaches to a mail or a GitHub
  issue. Any logged-in user, no consent involved: it hands them their own instance's
  sanitised error traces so a Rückmeldung can say more than "es ist abgestürzt". Nothing is
  transmitted by this route — the operator is, quite literally, the transport.

There used to be a third, ``POST /diag/report``: the Fehlerberichte form posted the operator's
text here and the forwarder carried it upstream. It went when the maintainer's ingest did. A
queued report with no destination is worse than no route at all, because the form says
«gesendet» and nothing ever arrives — so the form now opens a mail or an issue directly, and
the only thing this module owes it is the export above.

The contract for all of it: never 500, never trust the payload. A diagnostics sink that
becomes a source of errors is worse than no sink.
