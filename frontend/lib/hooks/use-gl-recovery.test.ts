// A lost WebGL context leaves the map a blank rectangle inside fully-working chrome – it doesn't
// read as a crash, and without this the only cure is reloading the page. Recovery rebuilds the map
// instance. The policy has to thread a needle: heal silently for the ordinary case (the GPU was
// reclaimed while nobody was looking), but never remount in a loop when the GPU keeps dropping us
// – that would replace a blank map with a flickering one.
