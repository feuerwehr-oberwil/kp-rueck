/**
 * WebGL context recovery for the GL maps. Copied from KP Front (`src/lib/useGlRecovery.ts`).
 *
 * A browser reclaims the WebGL context under memory pressure and after a long spell in the
 * background – routine for a board left open on a wall display for a whole shift. MapLibre does
 * not rebuild itself when that happens: the canvas goes blank while every bit of surrounding
 * chrome keeps working, so it doesn't even READ as a crash. There is nothing to click, and the
 * only cure is reloading the page – which an operator has no reason to guess at.
 *
 * Recovery is a fresh map instance (a new canvas + new GL resources), which in react-map-gl means
 * remounting `<Map>` under a new key. Policy: heal SILENTLY the first time (the operator most
 * likely never sees it – the context died while nobody was looking), but if the context dies
 * again in short order, stop remounting and hand the operator an explicit action instead of
 * looping.
